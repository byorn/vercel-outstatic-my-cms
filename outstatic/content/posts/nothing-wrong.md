I am in a stage in my life realising that most things in life is a paradox. The fact that everything is incomplete and imperfect makes everything perfect. I don't believe in life to be perfect but I do believe in thriving for perfection.

## Writing code is fun, when you are self aware the craft that takes place within you and not be carried away looking for a means to an end. 

In short the joy goes away if you try too hard for the "perfect completion" 

Only a few of us find joy in the code 

```javascript
const life = 'is great'
let love = 'is essential'
let happy = 'be'
```
