I was contemplating my journey with writing code and tech in general. Yes I like to brag and think of my self as a privileged individual with a passion for computers and programming.

I started writing in Java in 2003  Java 1.2 to be precise. I was involved in writing JSP and swing desktop application code for my employer.

But the year before that I was earning 5000 Srilankan rupees a month writing HRM and Payroll desktop clients in [Visual Basic, ](http://VB.NET)for a reputed banks CEO who had an idea for a startup.

But come to think of it, I really started looking at code in 1993. GW Basic, Lotus 123 and DBASE 3++.

In My Uni, back in Year 2000 we had hands on labs with C, C++, AS 400, Clipper, and Pascal.

From 2006 Onwards, it was mainly Java and Javascript and all its ecosystems.

I was faced with some projects where I had to code with C#, or Groovy.

As of recently I have been writing Golang as a hobby project.

Please find my GIT HUB repo [here](https://github.com/byorn/advent_of_code)

I also wrote a web server in Rust. Git Hub Repo is [here](https://github.com/byorn/learning_rust/tree/main/src)

I enjoy doing advent of code challenges, and my prefered language for that is Python.

Am in a stage of my life that I feel I can adapt to any code base and coding language and tech.
