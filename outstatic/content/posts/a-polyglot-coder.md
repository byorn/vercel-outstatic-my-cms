Reflecting on my journey with code and all things tech has been quite the ride. I may tend to boast a bit, but hey, when you're passionate about computers and programming, who can blame you?

My coding escapades officially kicked off in 2003 with Java 1.2. Ah, the memories of diving into JSP and crafting swing desktop applications for my employer still bring a nostalgic smile to my face.

But rewind a tad to 2002, where I was pulling in a modest sum of 5000 Sri Lankan rupees per month. My task? Crafting HRM and Payroll desktop clients in good ol' Visual Basic. All thanks to a visionary bank CEO with a startup itch.

Yet, if we really dig into the roots, 1993 marks the genesis. GW Basic, Lotus 123, and DBASE 3++ were my companions, sparking that initial fascination with code.

Flash forward to my university days in the early 2000s, where hands-on labs exposed me to the diverse world of C, C++, AS 400, Clipper, and Pascal. Talk about a smorgasbord of languages!

Then, from 2006 onward, it was a steady diet of Java and JavaScript, delving deep into their sprawling ecosystems. Of course, there were detours into the realms of C# and Groovy for various projects, keeping things spicy.

Lately, I've been tinkering with Golang as a side project, just for the sheer fun of it. You can check out my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/byorn/advent_of_code) for a peek at what I've been cooking up.

Oh, and let's not forget my foray into Rust, where I dared to craft a web server. Curious? Swing by my [GitHub](https://github.com/byorn/learning_rust/tree/main/src) and take a gander.

Now, when it comes to tackling advent of code challenges, Python is my trusty steed. There's just something about its simplicity and versatility that makes it the perfect companion for those brain-teasing puzzles.

As for where I stand now, well, let's just say I'm in a phase where I feel like I can adapt to any codebase, any language, any tech thrown my way. It's all part of the thrill of the coding adventure, isn't it?
