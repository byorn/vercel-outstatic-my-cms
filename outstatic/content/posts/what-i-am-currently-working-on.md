I set up my CMS by reading the documentation of the open-source project [Outstatic](https://github.com/avitorio/outstatic).

Initially, I attempted to host the project on AWS Amplify. However, after facing some challenges with the dev/ops work required to get Outstatic running, I opted to host it on Vercel instead. I created a subdomain, [cms.byorn-playground.com](http://cms.byorn-playground.com) to point to my Vercel-hosted CMS.

Currently, I am considering how to enable internet users to comment on my blogs to gather feedback. To address this, I started a discussion on the Outstatic open-source project to explore building a module that allows public user comments.

I have realised that this task will not be easy, especially since I want to authenticate users who comment on my blog posts. Therefore, I am currently focusing on developing this feature.

## My other million dollar idea and passion project

I am currently also designing a freelancer like platform where developers can log into and get paid for approved pull requests. It would be like a monetised version of github open source project except they would be for private projects which are not open sourced. If you want to join me on this venture, I would appreciate you reach out to me in [byorn.desilva@gmail.com](mailto:byorn.desilva@gmail.com).

Have a nice day!
