## Hello!

# I'm Byorn, nice to meet you.

I am a Lead Software Developer + Open source contributor + Tech Enthusiast and whatever else I can cram into this existence.

I love solving Code challenges like Advent of Code / Leet code in my free time. I also enjoy contributing and collaborating my thoughts to open source projects.

I have recently picked up a new hobby, which is to blog and upload coding videos. I still am thinking about live streaming coding videos in Twitch.

This is the start .. !
