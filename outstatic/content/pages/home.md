## Hello!

# I'm Byorn, nice to meet you.

I am a Lead Software Developer + Open source contributor + Tech Enthusiast + Blogger, and lastly a human being with an ego that  likes to believe that one can make  a difference in this world by solving problems with software code to ultimately enrich lives of possibly all living beings. 

I live and work in Australia, Sydney and work for the financial industry (banking/insurance). In my free time, I enjoy solving code challenges in like "Advent of Code" and "Leet Code" . I also enjoy contributing and collaborating my thoughts to open source projects.

I am currently looking into contributing to this open source cms project [outstatic](https://outstatic.com/) which also powers my cms.

I have recently picked up a new hobby, which is to blog and upload coding videos to my [main website](http://www.byorns-playground.com). 

I guess a "start" is all we need ...!
